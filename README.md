# KORAIL Mobile API APK Analysis

This repository combines a static reverse-engineering report for `korail.apk`,
the Android app package `com.korail.talk` version `6.5.0`, with an installable
read-only Python client derived from that evidence.

The original APK and generated decompile directories are intentionally not
committed. Documentation, reproducible inventory output, client source, and
offline contract tests are committed.

## Quick Start

Start here:

1. [docs/korail-apk-analysis.md](docs/korail-apk-analysis.md) - high-level APK, host, network, flow, WebView, storage, and security summary.
2. [docs/api-endpoints.md](docs/api-endpoints.md) - complete Retrofit endpoint table.
3. [docs/deep-dive/README.md](docs/deep-dive/README.md) - deep-dive manual index and reading order.
4. [docs/NEXT_SESSION.md](docs/NEXT_SESSION.md) - current handoff state for the next analysis session.

## Documentation Map

Core documents:

- [docs/api-endpoints.md](docs/api-endpoints.md): method/path/request parameter/return type inventory.
- [docs/deep-dive/api-contracts.md](docs/deep-dive/api-contracts.md): endpoint-by-endpoint request and response field contract.
- [docs/deep-dive/network-model-fields.md](docs/deep-dive/network-model-fields.md): Java model field catalog from decompiled network classes.
- [docs/deep-dive/webview-and-url-catalog.md](docs/deep-dive/webview-and-url-catalog.md): WebView bridge, URL, scheme, and API-like path catalog.
- [docs/deep-dive/local-storage-catalog.md](docs/deep-dive/local-storage-catalog.md): ORMLite DB model and SharedPreferences key catalog.
- [docs/deep-dive/agent-reports/](docs/deep-dive/agent-reports/): 20 focused subsystem reports.

## Local Artifacts

Ignored local files/directories:

- `korail.apk`: source APK input, not committed.
- `analysis/`: generated `unzip`, `apktool`, `jadx`, and extraction reports, not committed.
- `.DS_Store`: macOS metadata.

Expected local artifact layout after analysis:

```text
analysis/raw/
analysis/apktool/
analysis/jadx/
analysis/reports/
analysis/generated/
```

## Reproducing Static Inputs

Install tools if missing:

```bash
brew install jadx apktool
```

Regenerate decompile artifacts from a local `korail.apk`:

```bash
rm -rf analysis
mkdir -p analysis/raw analysis/reports analysis/generated
unzip -q korail.apk -d analysis/raw
apktool d -f korail.apk -o analysis/apktool
jadx -d analysis/jadx --show-bad-code korail.apk
```

JADX may report decompilation warnings for some library/UI classes. The network layer under `com.korail.talk.network.*` was still readable for the committed documentation. Use `analysis/apktool/smali*` as fallback evidence when Java-like output is ambiguous.

## Scope and Limits

Static analysis remains the evidence source for the APK inventory. The Python
client additionally supports explicitly opted-in live login and read-only smoke
verification using caller-supplied credentials and device identity.

The project does not provide:

- Authentication bypass
- NetFunnel or DynaPath bypass
- Reservation, payment, cancellation, refund, check-in, or member mutation APIs
- General-purpose runtime WebView automation

Server response values, feature flags, redirect behavior, and server-side
nullable/required rules remain unknown unless evidenced by a controlled,
authorized live observation.

## Python Package MVP

This repository now contains an installable Python client package under `src/korail_mobile_api`.

Default tests are offline:

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

### Account-neutral cache reads

`KorailClient.get_app_data()` and `KorailClient.get_notice()` expose the two
evidenced account-neutral cache reads:

- `GET /file/CACHE/prdMobilePlusMain.cache`
- `GET /file/CACHE/prdMobilePlusNotice.cache`

Both methods can run before login and send only a `timeStamp` query parameter.
They return frozen typed responses while retaining the original mapping through
the repr-hidden `raw` field. Supplying `timestamp_ms` gives callers a
deterministic cache key; omitting it uses the current Unix epoch in
milliseconds.

Live smoke is opt-in and limited to login plus read/query calls. DynaPath
device identity values must be supplied explicitly.
KORAIL_ADVERTISING_ID is optional and defaults to an empty string:

```bash
export KORAIL_MOBILE_API_LIVE=1
export KORAIL_MEMBER_NO="<member-id>"
export KORAIL_PASSWORD="<password>"
export KORAIL_DYNAPATH_DEVICE_ID="<android-id>"
export KORAIL_DYNAPATH_OS_VERSION="<android-version>"
export KORAIL_DYNAPATH_DEVICE_MODEL="<device-model>"
export KORAIL_ADVERTISING_ID=""
python3 -c "from korail_mobile_api.live import run_live_smoke_from_env; print(run_live_smoke_from_env())"
```

The helper performs both cache reads before login and emits only booleans,
status codes, and bounded counts. Its cache metadata is limited to
`appDataLoaded` and `noticeLoaded`; it does not return raw account, session,
ticket, station, app-data, or notice response bodies.

DynaPath is supported for the documented allowlist paths. Runtime constants
such as `Device`, API version, app key, DynaPath header name, and allowlist paths
are importable from the package. Live smoke constructs `DynapathTokenSettings`
only from required caller-supplied environment values and fails before request
construction when any required identity value is missing.

The built-in generator follows the successful fixed `rt=0` contract: SDK version `v1`,
four uppercase-letter-or-digit random characters, and exactly one
`rt=0` field in each token payload. The app-start timestamp is captured once
when live configuration is built; request history is not accumulated. The raw
application-signature setting is form-encoded exactly once during token
construction.

When enabled, the client attaches `DYNAPATH_HEADER_NAME` only for the documented
DynaPath allowlist paths. Callers that need an external implementation may
still provide a custom `DynapathConfig.token_provider`; the package contains no
separate probe generator and does not retain request history. Login follows the
app sequence and treats only `IRZ000001` or `S200` as final success.

Reservation, payment, refund, check-in, membership mutation, point/mileage mutation, and destructive ticket operations are not implemented in this package version.
